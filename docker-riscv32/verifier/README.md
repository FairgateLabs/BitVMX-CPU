# Groth16 Verifier

This folder contains a Docker file that is capable of building a gorth16 verifier.

Internally it checks out this repository https://github.com/FairgateLabs/bitvmx-zk-verifier which has a GNU license. This is a POC verifier that could be replaced at any time by other code.

The setup, prove generation, and some other data handling is described in this other repository:
